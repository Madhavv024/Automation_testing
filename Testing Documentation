1. Introduction

This document provides an overview of the testing process for the login feature of [Your Application Name]. The objective is to verify the functionality of the login process through a series of test cases.

2. Test Plan

Objective: The primary objective is to ensure the login feature functions correctly.
Testing Types: We will perform functional, usability, security, and error-handling testing.
Testing Strategy: Tests will be conducted manually in various environments.
Test Environment: Testing will be conducted on Windows and macOS using Chrome and Firefox browsers.
3. Test Cases

Test Case 1: Valid Login

4. Test Execution

Test Execution Schedule: Tests were executed on [Execution Date].
Test Data: Test data included valid and invalid usernames and passwords.
Execution Process: Tests were manually executed on the specified environments.


5. Test Results

Test Execution Logs: All test cases passed successfully.
Defect Reports: No defects were identified during testing.
Challenges Faced and Solutions

Challenge 1: In Test Case 3, the error message text was dynamic, and it was challenging to assert the exact text.
Solution: Instead of using .eql, we used .contains to check for the presence of "Invalid credentials" within the error message.
